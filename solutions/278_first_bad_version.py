        Binary search approach to find the first bad version.

        Algorithm Overview:
        - Use binary search to efficiently find the first bad version
        - Pattern: Finding boundary between OK and NG (meguru-style binary search)
        - Key insight: If version k is bad, all versions >= k are bad

        Approach:
        1. Initialize ok=0 (always good), ng=n+1 (always bad)
        2. While abs(ok-ng) > 1:
           - Check middle version
           - If good: move ok pointer to mid
           - If bad: move ng pointer to mid
        3. Return ng (first bad version)

        Time Complexity: O(log n)
        - Binary search reduces search space by half each iteration
        - Number of iterations: logâ‚‚(n)
        - Each iteration makes 1 API call

        Space Complexity: O(1)
        - Only using constant space for ok, ng, mid pointers
        - No recursion stack (iterative approach)
